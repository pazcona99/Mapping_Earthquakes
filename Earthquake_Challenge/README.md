# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating a visualization platform to map earthquakes and all things related to them.

# Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to take the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on a map of earth, and to visualize all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and an additional third map was provided for user customization. This analysis was used through coding in JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data. The tectonic plate data was added using d3.json() and the geoJSON() layer. The tectonic plate data was set using LineString data to stand out on the map, and the tectonic plate data was overlayed as an object with the earthquake data. The same appraoch was used for adding major earthquake data to the map that can also be toggled on or off.
